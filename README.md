Adds simple HTML snippets into [Prawn](http://prawnpdf.org)-generated PDFs. No CSS is supported, all elements are layouted vertically with basic styling options. A major use case for this gem is to include WYSIWYG-generated HTML parts into server-generated PDF documents.

This gem does not and will never convert entire HTML + CSS pages to PDF. Use [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/) for that.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'prawn-markup'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install prawn-markup
